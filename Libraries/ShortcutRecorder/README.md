Shortcut Recorder
=================

Shortcut Recorder is a wonderful open-source control that presents the user with the ability to specify a keyboard shortcut by simply typing it.

The official home for Shortcut Recoder is here:

The ZIP file in this directory contains a slightly modified version of Shortcut Recorder used by Feeds. Because Shortcut Recorder is not on Github, I can't easily fork the repository and maintain my own version, so I simply zipped up the whole thing with my modifications and placed it here for future reference.
